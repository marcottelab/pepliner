Make data subset actually initiate download of csv instead of html page

? Make 'submit' button for for updating plots. Slow to change multiple things now ?

? Make pepplot and covplot react separately, so both don't have to be made with facet updates ?

? Collapse plot options?

Change Data upload to check column names, and restate need for ID columns etc.
