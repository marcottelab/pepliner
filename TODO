TO DO

Make optional columns more optional (especially condition)

? Make 'submit' button for for updating plots. Slow to change multiple things now ?

? Collapse plot options?

Change Data upload to check column names, and restate need for ID columns etc. 

Really need to fix alignment of sparklines and peptide coverage plot

Write paper

Make figures

Make vignette of example. Use same code as pepliner. Package code into functions??

Probably to avoid repeats or not probably to increase customizability

Check style for tidyverse using functions

ERRORS

Something is definitely up with the peptie coverage mapping after pepliner R code change

Peptides containing J not mapping?? AAFVTSPPJSPDPTTPDYJNSJJASGDJQJSGSAHCTFSTAQK

Uploading dataframe with NA means normalization doesn't happen. 
    Important to check/fix. Needs warning, not just overwrite NA with zero
    Or maybe warn to check that there are no NA if no row displays

Fix download filename from pdf from pepplot



TESTS TO WRITE


- Check that uppercase/lowercase matches work
- Check that weird inputs work
- Check that fasta headers with annotations work
- Check that Data with NA's are rejected with a warning of what the problematic rows are?
